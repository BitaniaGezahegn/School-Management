You're absolutely right! Since you included **room management** earlier (but excluded scheduling), here's the updated page list with the **`rooms.html`** page added:

---

### **Final Page List**  
1. **`login.html`**  
   - Simple login form (account/password).  

2. **`index.html`** *(Admin Dashboard)*  
   - Summary stats + quick links to all pages.  

3. **`students.html`** *(Admin Only)*  
   - CRUD operations for students.  

4. **`teachers.html`** *(Admin Only)*  
   - CRUD operations for teachers.  

5. **`courses.html`** *(Admin Only)*  
   - CRUD operations for courses.  

6. **`rooms.html`** *(Admin Only)* *(NEW)*  
   - CRUD operations for rooms (Lab/Lecture).  

7. **`marks.html`** *(Teachers & Admin)*  
   - Input/edit grades.  

8. **`grades.html`** *(Students Only)*  
   - View personal grades.  

---

### **`rooms.html` Content**  
**Header**: "Room Management"  
**Table**:  
| Room ID | Building No. | Room Type (Lab/Lecture) | Actions |  
|---------|-------------|------------------|---------|  
| R02     | B001        | Lab              | Edit/Delete |  

**Add Room Form**:  
- Fields:  
  - `Room ID` (text input, e.g., "R05")  
  - `Building Number` (text input, e.g., "B002")  
  - `Room Type` (dropdown: Lab/Lecture)  
- **Submit** button  

---

### **How It Fits In**  
- **Admin** can:  
  - Add/edit/delete rooms (e.g., labs for science courses).  
- **Teachers/Students** *cannot* access this page (hidden in navigation).  

---

### **Navigation Updates**  
Add this to the admin sidebar (`index.html`):  
```html
<a href="rooms.html">Manage Rooms</a>
```

---

### **Backend Adjustments**  
1. **SQL**: Already included in your schema (`room_id`, `bid_num`, `room_type`).  
2. **PHP**: Reuse the same CRUD logic as `students.html`/`teachers.html`.  

---

### **Do You Want?**  
1. A **prompt to generate `rooms.html`** (like the login page)?  
2. Any changes to the room fields (e.g., add `capacity`)?  
3. Merge it with another page (e.g., `courses.html`)?  

Let me knowâ€”this keeps the system minimal but functional!
